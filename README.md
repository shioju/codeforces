These are my solutions to codeforces.com problems. If you know of a better way to solve any of them, i'd love to hear from you! You can either create an issue or email me.

## Finding the original problem statement
The problem statements can be found on `https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/<directory>/<filenameWithoutExtension>`. For example, the problem for `96/a` can be found at `https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/96/a`.

## My assessment of the difficulty ratings on codeforces.com
Based on the problems i've attempted so far:

| Difficulty | What is needed to solve this (on top of skills from lower difficulty)        |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 800        | conditionals                                                                 |
| 900        | loops                                                                        |
| 1000       | math, simple puzzle                                                          |

| 1400       | 2d transformations, bitmask, heap, large numbers                             |
| 1500       | repeated operations between 2 x 1d-arrays, memoization                       |
| 1600       | hard-coded maps, tree traversal with info tracking, combinatorics (n^2 -> n) |
| 1900       | combinatorics (n^4 -> n^2)                                                   |

Let me know if you encounter a problem which doesn't match up to my table above.
